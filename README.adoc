* Jave SE 11 (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.se/module-summary.html), but trying to use only
** `java.base` (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html)
** `java.logging` (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.logging/module-summary.html)
* Kotlin standard library for Common and JVM targets (https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/)
